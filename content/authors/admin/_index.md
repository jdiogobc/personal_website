Due to being extremely passionate and curious I always managed to stand out both in my work and my personal achievements. My tirelessness determination made me a good multi-tasker and an independent learner. With these characteristics, throughout my life, I managed to flex between playing music for hundreds of people, being honoured with academic awards and winning national sports competitions.
