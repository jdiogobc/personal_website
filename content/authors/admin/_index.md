<i>"Seems like a fun idea, I think I can do it!"</i>

This one single phrase got me not only into engineering, but also into music, extreme sports and visual arts.<br>
Curiosity, creativity and enthusiasm helped me turning ideas into "things" which made me stand out both in my work and my personal projects.
With these characteristics, throughout my life, I managed to achieve academic honours and win engineering competitions,
but also get into activities that are not quite the engineer stereotype.
