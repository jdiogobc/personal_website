This was a 7 month project designed, built and conducted by my with mentorship of Professor Reinhold Scherer.
This "whack-a-mole" game used online co-adaptive learning to adapt it's parameters to the user's input. Meaning that different players
could use different mental approaches to play the same game. The game would pick up brain patterns live and adapt to them.

This game's preliminary results resulted in a publication in the "2018 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW)".

There is currently a second publication under review.

My master thesis was built on it, and its linked above under "PDF"
