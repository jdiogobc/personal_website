When a dear friend had their hand movement impaired, they couldn't believe their hand was having a slow and steady recovery.
I jumped on the opportunity to assure them that there was a qualitatively measurable improvement in their hand movement. 
I hold this project very dearly as I managed to have some real-world direct impact with a technology that is frequently so forward looking that it misses its own present potential.
