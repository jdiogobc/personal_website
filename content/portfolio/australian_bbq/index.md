<a href="https://ines-almeida.com">Inês Almeida</a> and I are currently developing a VR video-game where you need to save your Barbaque by "shooing" away the wildlife that is trying to steal your beer! It's a comedic arcade game that has boomerang throwing as its main mechanic.
The boomerangs return using a automatically generated Bézier curve too look smooth and feel nice.
