This was a 2 month project, in collaboration with Jos√© Franco. We developed a game using LeapMotion for hand tracking,
bitalino for biosignal (ECG) reading, and VRidge for phone-computer VR integration.
It's an arcade survival game where the user uses hand gestures to cast spells. The spells will cause more damage but drain
more energy if the user has elevated heart rate, so one must keep calm to preserve energy, but excitement will cause more damage.
